# MD034 — No Bare URLs (Repository Standard)

This repo enforces Markdown lint rule MD034: no bare-urls. Any plain URL like
`https://example.com` must be written either as `<https://example.com>` or with
explicit link text like `[Dashboard](https://example.com)`.

Why: Bare URLs can render inconsistently, break autolinking, and fail checks in
CI. Using angle brackets or link text is explicit and portable.

## Acceptable forms

- Angle-bracket autolink: `<https://dashboard.render.com>`
- With text: `[Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)`

## Not acceptable

- Bare: `https://dashboard.render.com`

## One-shot auto-fix (Windows/PowerShell)

Use the repo script to systematically wrap bare URLs with angle brackets, while
skipping fenced code blocks and inline code spans.

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\fix-md034.ps1
```

What it does:

- Scans all `*.md` files recursively.
- Skips fenced code blocks (```), so code samples are untouched.
- Skips URLs already inside `()` or `<>` or inline code (`` `...` ``).
- Wraps remaining bare URLs as `<https://...>`.
- Prints a summary of files changed.

Tip: Commit your work before running, so you can review the diff cleanly.

## CI and Deploy reminders

After docs are fixed and pushed, you can trigger the deploy hooks:

- GitHub → Actions → "Render/Vercel Deploy"
- Click "Run workflow" and choose environment: `production` or `staging`
- The job POSTs your deploy hooks and writes a summary of what fired.

If the workflow is missing secrets, add:

- `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL_BACKEND`
- `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL_FRONTEND_PROD`
- (optional) `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL_FRONTEND_STAGING`

Keep PRs small and focused: docs-only PRs are welcome when fixing MD034.
